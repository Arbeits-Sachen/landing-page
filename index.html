      <main>One of my hobbies is programming and gaining more knowledge in this field. In my spare time, I recently read books about new programming techniques and machine learning. However, I often engage in writing and developing different codes for different applications. Another hobby of mine is playing football, which I have been doing since a young age. Football is not just a physical activity, but somewhere I can spend time socializing with my friends. Nevertheless, if I do have less time, I go to my local gym to work out, which not only helps me to stay fit but also allows me to train my mind. Furthermore, another field of interest that is less physical and more creative is playing with Lego Technic. Lego Technic is the ideal activity to apply innovative thinking by building different kinds of pieces of machinery or systems. I have not worked on different models such as the Bugatti Chiron, but I have developed and programmed Lego robotics to carry out certain tasks. On itch.io, I recently uploaded the games that I've made.</main><br>
